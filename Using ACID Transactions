1. Update your stored procedure definition. Add a generic ELSE clause to the IF statement 
   that rolls back the current work if the score did not fit any of the preceding categories.
>>

--SET TERMINATOR@
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE UPDATE_LEADERS_SCORE(
IN in_School_ID INTEGER, IN in_Leader_Score INTEGER)

LANGUAGE SQL 
MODIFIES SQL DATA 

BEGIN 
	UPDATE CHICAGO_PUBLIC_SCHOOLS
	SET "Leaders_Score" = in_Leader_Score
	WHERE "School_ID" = in_School_ID;
		IF in_Leader_Score>0 and in_Leader_Score<20
		THEN 
			UPDATE CHICAGO_PUBLIC_SCHOOLS
			SET "Leaders_Icon" = 'Very Weak' ; 
		elseif in_Leader_Score<40
		then 
			UPDATE CHICAGO_PUBLIC_SCHOOLS
			SET "Leaders_Icon" = 'Weak' ;
		elseif in_Leader_Score<60
		then 
			UPDATE CHICAGO_PUBLIC_SCHOOLS
			SET "Leaders_Icon" = 'Average' ;
		elseif in_Leader_Score<80
		then 
			UPDATE CHICAGO_PUBLIC_SCHOOLS
			SET "Leaders_Icon" = 'Strong' ;
		elseif in_Leader_Score<100
		then 
			UPDATE CHICAGO_PUBLIC_SCHOOLS
			SET "Leaders_Icon" = 'Very Strong' ;
		else 
			ROLLBACK WORK;
		ENDIF;
END

2. Update your stored procedure definition again. Add a statement to commit the 
current unit of work at the end of the procedure.
>>>

--SET TERMINATOR@
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE UPDATE_LEADERS_SCORE(
IN in_School_ID INTEGER, IN in_Leader_Score INTEGER)

LANGUAGE SQL 
MODIFIES SQL DATA 

BEGIN 
	UPDATE CHICAGO_PUBLIC_SCHOOLS
	SET "Leaders_Score" = in_Leader_Score
	WHERE "School_ID" = in_School_ID;
		IF in_Leader_Score>0 and in_Leader_Score<20
		THEN 
			UPDATE CHICAGO_PUBLIC_SCHOOLS
			SET "Leaders_Icon" = 'Very Weak' ; 
		elseif in_Leader_Score<40
		then 
			UPDATE CHICAGO_PUBLIC_SCHOOLS
			SET "Leaders_Icon" = 'Weak' ;
		elseif in_Leader_Score<60
		then 
			UPDATE CHICAGO_PUBLIC_SCHOOLS
			SET "Leaders_Icon" = 'Average' ;
		elseif in_Leader_Score<80
		then 
			UPDATE CHICAGO_PUBLIC_SCHOOLS
			SET "Leaders_Icon" = 'Strong' ;
		elseif in_Leader_Score<100
		then 
			UPDATE CHICAGO_PUBLIC_SCHOOLS
			SET "Leaders_Icon" = 'Very Strong' ;
		else 
			ROLLBACK WORK;
		ENDIF;
			COMMIT WORK;
END
