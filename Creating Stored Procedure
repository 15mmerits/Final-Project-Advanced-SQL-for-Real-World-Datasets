1. Write the structure of a query to create or replace a stored procedure called UPDATE_LEADERS_SCORE that takes a in_School_ID parameter 
as an integer and a in_Leader_Score parameter as an integer.
>>

--#SET TERMINATOR @
CREATE PROCEDURE UPDATE_LEADERS_SCORE(
IN in_School_ID INTEGER,
IN in_Leader_Score INTEGER)

LANGUAGE SQL
READS SQL DATA

DYNAMIC RESULT SETS 1
 
BEGIN
 
   	DECLARE C1 CURSOR 
   	WITH RETURN FOR 
	
   	SELECT * FROM CHICAGO_PUBLIC_SCHOOLS;

   	OPEN C1;
   	
END

@

............................................................................................................................

2. 
Inside your stored procedure, write a SQL statement to update the Leaders_Score field in the 
CHICAGO_PUBLIC_SCHOOLS table for the school identified by in_School_ID to the value in the 
in_Leader_Score parameter.
   
>>

--#SET TERMINATOR@
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE UPDATE_LEADERS_SCORE(
IN in_School_ID INTEGER, 
IN in_Leader_Score INTEGER)

LANGUAGE SQL 
MODIFIES SQL DATA 

BEGIN
 
	UPDATE CHICAGO_PUBLIC_SCHOOLS
	SET "Leaders_Score"=in_Leader_Score
	WHERE "School_ID"=in_School_ID;
	
END 

@

3.
Inside your stored procedure, write a SQL IF statement to update the Leaders_Icon field in 
the CHICAGO_PUBLIC_SCHOOLS table for the school identified by in_School_ID using the 
following information.

Score lower limit	Score upper limit	Icon
80					99					Very strong
60					79					Strong
40					59					Average
20					39					Weak
0					19					Very weak
